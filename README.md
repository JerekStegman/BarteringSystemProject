# INFSCI 1400: Campus Bliss

## Project Description
- This is a project with the idea of app creation. We were tasked with finding a root problem and working from there to help college students. Our group decided (see presentation) to focus on the problem of the low quality of life among students. We created an application that focuses on benefiting students and improving their quality of life through different features.
